Slow Articulation
Definition of Voice Quality and How to measure:
Vocal Quality is hard to define and measure since it is acoustic Perceptual phenomenon.
Listener Introduce Variability of Voice Quality
Vagaries of scale definition
Vocal quality is psychology index, not physical index. (Luo)

Some label of vocal quality
Clear, Hollow, Bright, …
Speech Clarity

=> It is complex to define and measure currently.

How valence expressed vocally?
- The expected occurence of goal-congruent cause:
	- Low Pitch, Intensity, slow articulation, abdominal breathing, low respiratory
- The unexpected occurence of goal-congruent cause:
	- Hight Pitch, pitch range, intensity, thoracic breathing, quick respiratory

- Goudbeek & Scherer (2010)
	- composite scores for acoustic parameters  to determine the predictive power of these parameters
for the underlying dimensions of arousal, valence, and potency
	- Arousal dominate other parameters
	- spectral balance and spectral noise related to valence and potency

- Banziger & Scherer 2010
	- GEMEP with 12 emotion with 3 dimension
- Juslin & Laukka (2003)
	- Arousal in determine vocal parameters is established
	- Less evidence for the contribution of valence and potency to vocal emotion expression

- Briefer 2012, Ko et al. 2015
	- High Prospective Control cause changes of formant changes, and so on
- Goudbeek & Scherer 2010, Johnstone et al. 2001
	- Low perspective Control cause  f0 and f0 range, vocal intensity, the energy of the harmonics, and the rate
of articulation
- Johnstone et al. 2001, Paulmann et al. 2016
	-Low perspective control and high mental stress cause …

- Handbook of Affective Computing
	- it is easy to derive appropriate acoustic modification rules for the “arousal” dimension, because this is directly related to muscle tension, but it is very difficult for the other dimensions


Emotion Modeling
	- Categorical system
	- Emotional dimension
	- Appraisal theory
	- OCC model


- Smiling affect vocal expression



Terminology
- The orienting response
- sympathetic response
- raise vocal fold tension
Appraisal Criteria:
novelty, intrinsic valence, goal congruence, urgency, agency, prospective control, and fairness

inference of appraisals from vocal expressions
Emotion(perception) <=> Appraisal rate <==> Acoustic measure

Thinking
Detect Goal(From text) + Current Situation => Appraisal by critera => emo embedding => vocal feature

changes in formant structure
Briefer 2012, Ko et al. 2015

 f0 and f0 range, vocal intensity, the energy of the harmonics, and the rate of articulation
There is less evidence for the contribution of valence and potency to vocal emotion expression
Banse & Scherer 1996

Identify parameters that are specifically related to valence and potency, in particular spectral balance and spectral noise.
