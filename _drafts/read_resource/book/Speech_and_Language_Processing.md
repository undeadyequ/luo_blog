### 18 Information Extraction 325
- Named Entity Recognition
- Relation Extraction
  - Pattern
    - such as/ and / or / especially / including
  - Supervised Learning used for matching similarity
  - Semi Supervised Learning used for finding new pattern by bootstrap
  - Unsupervised Learning used for ...

### 19 Word Senses and WordNet 354
- Word Senses
  - Dictionary:  contextual definition
  - Thesauruses: Synonymy
  -
- WordNet
  -
- Word Sense Disambiguation
  - Contextual Embeddings

### 20 Semantic Role Labeling 373
  - Generalized Semantic Role
  - Proposition Bank
    - Semantic role based on individual Verb
  - Frame Bank
    - collection lexicon of frame-specific
  - semantic constraint

### 26 Dialogue Systems and Chatbots 487

- Rule-Based
  - Rule/Transform, Keyword -> transform sentence
    - How Does the hand-make rules decide?

- Corpus-based
  - Response the one whose Question is Similar in Corpus
  - Regardless of Contextual info
  - Narrative Corpus also works

- ED-based
  -	Diff from normal E-D model
    1.	Need Avoid Null meaning response
    2.	Need Add consequence Question                                    
      - GAN <=  Increasing Diversity of conversation
      - RL  <=  Add overall naturalness as reword
  - Too long, Too Short sequence

- Task-specific Conversational agent
 - GUS System   <=   Frame-based Dialogue System

### 27 Phonetics 518
