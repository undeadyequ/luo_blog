2/3:
1. Vocoder - Gan implement or grifflim
  - grifflim problem
  - n_fft, hop_length, window_length, n_mels
  - iven_mel_basis * (mel_basis * mags) != mags ??
    - np.linalg.pinv(mel_basis) psuedo inverse matrix is problem?
    - mels -> mags is lossy Process, and make sure frequency warping is similar with mels extracting, otherwise disharmonic audio



2. Implement Category VAE
  - Dim(z) = base_dim(z) * Categories ? why?
  - no Linear model for mu, theta ?

2/5
- Learn to see spectrogram
  - Pitch rise/drop ?
  -
- See the every detail in each stage to check the training Process
  - emo VS emo_feats!


2/9

decode/syn in espnet1
1. decode and synthesis step

decode/syn in espnet2
1. Dot(invers_mel_basis, mags) directly in logmel2linear of Text2speech.
2. Vocoder by parallel_wavegan

2/10

- Jane-eye sample rate
  - re-extract feats/emo-feats again
  - **fmax=7600, fmin=80**


- Training multiple model
  - tacotron2
  - tacotron2_contrl
  - tacotron2_emocontrl_dnn
  - tacotron2_emocontrl_cvae (2h)
  (
    - exp name
    - eval data setting
    -
  )


2/11
- check fs in emofeats extraction
- reduce to ang, hap, sad, neutral?
- evaluate b2013 data

- Check Correct and Computable of emotional sub space   ORDER1 (2h)
  - data: iemocap(eval)
  - model: DNN_3_256
  - Vis: 6 space -> 3 space
  - Check Correctness
    - color = label
  - check Computable
    - color_durkness = label_dims


- Check if emo audio is generated correctly with psd vector

In training
1. text ->(text_psd) psd + [txt_enc] -> mels
2. audio -> emofeats -> emolabs ->(emo_feats_psd) psd + [txt_enc] -> mels  (problem in inference)
3. text + emo_labs ->(text_emo_psd) psd + (txt_enc) -> mels


exp1. 3 psd encoder
  - data:
  - evaluate: psd_loss in evaluate data
  - hyposis :


Inference
emolabs -> psd + [txt_enc] -> mels
emofeats -> emolabs -> psd + [txt_enc] -> mels


Learned
- epoch148 caused word skip than epoch105
